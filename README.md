#   swiftify new tab chrome extension
Replace new tab page with a personal new tab, tailored to your liking, with a little bit of taylor swift content. Every refresh is another chance for another picture. This page is flexible to many preferences, allowing you to get the most out of every new tab.<br>
This is dedicated to my friend, Cambrie, the biggest taylor swift fan I know, whose birthday is coming up.
